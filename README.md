This program was designed to simulate CPU scheduling.
The idea behind this design is that once a file, 
whose name is specified at the command line, or input
is received from STDIN is read, the program will then
take the input and create strcuts containing member 
information related to CPU scheduling to conduct
calculations on to represent the typical scheduling
of processes in a CPU.
--------------------------------------------------------
Anticipated bugs may include:
- errors on actually receiving input from either 
the .txt file or STDIN. 
- errors on accessing elements from struct array
- errors related to memory allocation for struct
array or for an individual struct
- difficulties in comparing specific elements of
individual structs within the struct array
